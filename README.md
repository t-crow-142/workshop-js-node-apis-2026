# WDCC - server-side JavaScript, Node.js, Express & APIs

The activity for this workshop will be based on a live demo working through and building an server side API (Application Programming Interface). The slides will cover fundamental concepts of API development which will then be practised in the practical component of this workshop.

You will be exposed to basics behind the main communication protocol online websites use 🌍! From binge watching shows, banking to that random google search, everything online uses an API of some sort 👩‍💻👨‍💻.

## Task

Using the provided code in the `exercise` folder, create a basic HTTP API which will **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** data (CRUD) from a simulated database.

Look for `app.js` inside the `exercise/src` path. Follow along with the live demo as we complete each `TODO` task in the code.

Read through a little bit of the code, spending most of our time following along, setting up, and coding with Postman and NodeJS to solve any bugs.

As we approach this task, we'll be using a tool called Postman (there are alternatives) to interact with the API on the server. This is a form of manual testing to break something (possibly complex) into smaller testable chunks, which important when working with servers.

Here's an overview of tasks. Note you may discover additional tasks which is normal during coding - explore and have fun (while focusing on APIs):

- Get the code (without the server yet) in the exercise folder up and running
  - `> npm install`
  - `> npm run dev`
  - Install Postman?
    - VSCode Extension requires you to create an account
    - Standalone download is not as integrated, but has it's own perks (including not needing account).
- Add in express server code to start listening for HTTP API requests
- Test the server is working and listening using Postman for the first time
- Add in any useful logging extensions
  - `npm install morgan`
  - Integrate morgan with the server code as a middleware
- Complete the following APIs, paying **careful** attention to word-by-word correctness in the request declaration e.g. `app.get("/api/contacts"....`
  - `GET http://localhost:3000/api/contacts`
  - `POST http://localhost:3000/api/contacts`
  - `PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/contacts/<some-id>`
  - `DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/contacts/<some-id>`
  - Extra: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/contacts/<some-id>`
- We're done! Feel free to add in anything extra if we have time to spare.

### Data Storage (Database) note

This server-side workshop simplifies possible unrelated errors by not using a proper database. This also means we need to **keep in mind that data is reset between server restarts**. However, a mock database and data access functions have been included that simulate how a database would be accessed and modified through calls to JavaScript functions. Databases will be covered in a later workshop.

## Getting Help

The goal is to start running the code in the example folder with `npm run dev` command as soon as possible - thereby allowing you to start interacting with your server using HTTP API requests and hopefully getting some info back!

Feel free to ask for help as soon as we complete the brief lecture(s). The goal today is to have fun ✨ and learn at your own pace - make sure to reach out with help if you feel a little stuck 😊.

### Backup solutions

You have been provided with an `exercise-solution` directory which contains a version of the completed code in case you get stuck; however, the goal of the workshop is to work through step by step in order to build the server-side app and understand the process of creating it - everytime we find a bug - it's a great learning opportunity!

## End note

The HTTP API created in this workshop is designed to be the **backend** that connects to the **frontend** user interface that was prototyped in the HTML & CSS workshop, and the React user interface that you will create in the next workshop.

The final user interface that will be completed at the end of the workshop series will allow a user to interact with the full functionality of the API you will build in this workshop. It will look something like this at the end:
